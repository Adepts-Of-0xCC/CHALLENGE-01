# CHALLENGE-01
Dear Fell**owl**ship, is a pleasure to us to release our first challenge.

You can find the write up here:

[In the land of PHP you will always be (use-after-)free](https://adepts.of0x.cc/challenge01-php-uaf/)

# Rules
Keep the things simple. Here you have the source code and docker files to replicate the environment in your own lab. 

1. **NO BRUTEFORCE / NO RACE CONDITION** is needed. Just upload your sinful PHP file, get RCE and read the flag.
2. The flag is at **/flag**. Once you get the flag send it to [@TheXC3LL](https://twitter.com/TheXC3LL) and also share the write-up as a gists (https://gist.github.com/).
3. If you believe you got the flag in an unintended way, please report it so we can fix it **:D**.
4. Next weekend we are going to release the write-up.
